We originally used two different thresholds to classify mouse and human HK
genes based on gene expression across a compendium of tissues (one
stringent, one relaxed), but didn¹t notice a difference in either case, so
we generally use the longer lists just to get more data points for the
metric.

I¹m attaching the gene lists for mouse and human:
