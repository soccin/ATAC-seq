Subject: Results for Project ATAC_PROJECT_NUM ATACseq ready
The output for the ATACseq pipeline is now ready. You can access it at:

   https://bicdelivery.mskcc.org/project/ATAC_PROJECT_NUM/chipseq/r_001

The ATACseq specific results are in the folder

   atacSeq

Where you will find the following subfolders:

- bigwig: These are the coverage profiles in bigwig format. Can be loaded into IGV to get a figure of the coverage. 

- macs: the raw output from the MACS peak calling program.

- atlas: this contains a bed and txt file that has the merged list of peaks found in all samples

- metrics: Plots of various QC metrics for the samples.

   - Proj_ATAC_PROJECT_NUM__postInsDistribution.pdf: simple fragment length distribution. There should be some signature of nucleosomal periodicity.

   - Proj_ATAC_PROJECT_NUM__ATACSeqQC.pdf

      - Plots of Signal Portion of Tags (SPoT); which shows both the number and percentage of reads in peaks.

      - PCA from the peak atlas. Can be used to look for potential outliers
